# Event Resources
The idea behind this respository is to be able to create a place to save and share any event planning resources for the local LA tech (Meetup) community, including... 

- Workshops 
- Happy Hours / Mixers 
- Small Group Get-Togethers
- Hackathons
- Conferences / Panels 
- Youth Mentorship Events 

More coming soon!
